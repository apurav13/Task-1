<p>
Rural development usually refers to the method of enhancing the quality of life and financial well-being of individuals, specifically living in populated and remote areas.<br>

Traditionally, rural development was centred on the misuse of land-intensive natural resources such as forestry and agriculture. However today, the increasing urbanisation and the change in global production networks have transformed the nature of rural areas.<br>

Rural development still remains the core of the overall development of the country. More than two-third of the country�s people are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, and one-third of rural India is still below the poverty line. Therefore, it is important for the government to be productive and provide enough facilities to upgrade their standard of living.<br>

Rural development is a term that concentrates on the actions taken for the development of rural areas to improve the economy. However, few areas that demand more focused attention and new initiatives are:<br>

1.Education<br>
2.Public health and Sanitation<br>
3.Women empowerment<br>
4.Infrastructure development (electricity, irrigation, etc.)<br>
5.Facilities for agriculture extension and research<br>
6.Availability of credit<br>
7.Employment opportunities</p>

<h2><font color="#000080">Importance</font></h2>
<p>
Rural development is important not only for the majority of the population residing in rural areas, but also for the overall economic expansion of the nation.<br>

Rural development is considered to be of noticeable importance in the country today than in the olden days in the process of the evolution of the nation. It is a strategy that tries to obtain an improved  and productivity, higher socio-economic equality and ambition, and stability in social and economic development.<br>

The primary task is to decrease the famine that exists in roughly about 70 percent of the rural population, and to make sufficient and healthy food available.<br>

The secondary task is to ensure the availability of clothing and footwear, a clean environment and house, medical attention, recreational provision, education, transport, and communication.<br>

<h2><font color="#000080">What is Rural Development in India?</font></h2>
<p>
With the passage of several decades since independence, the Indian government has stressed the need for rural development in India.<br>
The task for You: Find out how rural development fuels the overall economic growth of India?<br>
To begin with, rural development stands for the increase in income opportunities for people living in rural areas. According to the Population Census of 2011, the percentage of people residing in rural areas is close to 69% of the Indian population.<br>
It roughly translates to about 83.3 crore Indians who are settled in rural areas. Thus, rural development also includes the measures implemented by government bodies to curb the poverty rate in such areas.<br>
As per another report by the Government of India, the percentage of the Indian population that was situated Below the Poverty Line (BPL) in 2011-2012 amounted to 21.9%. Needless to say, people affected by rural poverty contribute to a large chunk of the percentage. Therefore, the development of rural areas in terms of economy and viability of professional options is much needed. Through this progress, a sizable portion of the Indian population will find
 themselves out of the BPL group.</p>

<h2><font color="#000080">What are the Objectives of Rural Development in India?  </font></h2>
<p>With the concept of rural development explained, let�s move on to what rural development aims to achieve. First of all, decision-making entities ensure positive durable changes to boost the economy of a rural area. As a result, dedicated areas will witness a long-lasting growth pattern that is likely to reduce poverty rates. 
However, the primary objectives of rural development include the following �<br>
<ul>
<li>To promote economic growth among the rural population through adequate access to food, shelter, clothing, education, and employment. With proper opportunities proportional to the same in urban areas, individuals residing in rural areas will be able to get a level ground for income options.</li>

<li>To introduce modern techniques for agriculture in rural areas to contribute to an increased productivity rate. As a result, the role of rural development is to establish sustainable and affordable technology to increase production in a national market.</li>

<li>To ensure consistent rural infrastructure development in India. In addition, this process should involve all local rural populations. Consequently, they will gain the agency to make large-scale economic decisions that lead to area-based financial development.</li>

<li>To bridge the gap between local governing bodies and the Central administration for better economic communication. On top of that, rural development aims to provide executive powers to panchayats for carrying on the policies framed by experts.</li>
</ul> 

Finally, the objective of rural development is to use natural resources within a territory to ensure maximum economic benefit for inhabitants. This also includes important land reform measures to boost the agricultural output and productivity of every individual involved.<br>

Now that we know what the concept of rural development in India aims to achieve, let�s progress to the elements that impact rural growth.

<h2><font color="#000080"> What are the Factors that Affect Rural Development in India?</font></h2>

As a result, they will be able to pinpoint the nature of factors that have a direct impact on rural development.<br>

Therefore, factors affecting the rural development in India are duly stated below �<br>

<b>Infrastructure �</b> The infrastructural condition of a rural area has a direct link with its scale of development. Primarily, infrastructure consists of pucca roads, a consistent supply of electricity, and availability of transport.<br>


With these factors, governing bodies have been able to reduce connectivity issues related to thes�
 As a result, there has been an increase in the efficiency of the supply of agricultural output to mainland markets all over India. Therefore the opportunity of income increases among the rural residents.<br> 


<b>Education �</b> It is quite obvious that the level of education plays an integral role in the overall progress of rural areas.

As a result, they will be able to participate in healthy competitions in the market. Proper healthcare systems also reduce the mortality rate, thus ensuring a healthy and meaningful life.<br>

<b>Technology �</b> The role of technology in rural development is indisputable. First of all, modern production techniques in various sectors can actively increase their rate of production, which allows for a remarkable rise in the scale of economic activities in rural areas. On the other hand, the technology significantly reduces irrigation and quality issues. Therefore, the presence of appropriate technological means such as pumps, tractors is the make-or-break factor of rural development.<br>
